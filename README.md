# Movie-Recommender-System
In this project I have implemented a movie recommender system using item based collobarative filter.
Basically recommender systems are used to suggest songs or movies to customers based on their interest or usage history.
For example, Netflix recommends movies to watch based on the previous movies you've watched.
